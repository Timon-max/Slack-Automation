# Bot Filter Fix - Stop Bot Messages from Triggering Loop

## üö® The Problem

You're filtering on `15.authorizations.is_bot` but this checks if the *app* is a bot, not if the *message* is from a bot.

**Your data shows:**
```
authorizations:
  user_id: U09NHH78SQK
  is_bot: true           ‚Üê This means the APP is a bot
```

But you need to check if the **event** (message) is from a bot!

## ‚úÖ The Solution

### Replace ALL instances of:
```
15.authorizations.is_bot = false
15.authorizations.is_bot is NOT equal to true
```

### With these TWO conditions:
```
15.event.subtype does NOT exist
AND
15.event.bot_id does NOT exist
```

## üìã Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Update Module 32 (Check if exists)
If it has a filter, add:
- Condition: `15.event.subtype` does NOT exist
- Condition: `15.event.bot_id` does NOT exist

### Step 2: Update Module 28 (Store Event)
Filter should have ALL of these:
- `32.exist` equals `false`
- `15.event.subtype` does NOT exist  ‚Üê ADD
- `15.event.bot_id` does NOT exist   ‚Üê ADD

### Step 3: Update Module 13 (Fetch Notion)
Filter should have ALL of these:
- `15.event.type` equals `"event_callback"`
- `15.event.event.type` equals `"message"`
- `15.event.subtype` does NOT exist  ‚Üê ADD
- `15.event.bot_id` does NOT exist   ‚Üê ADD
- `15.event.user` not equal to `"U09JV1FUPMJ"`

### Step 4: Update Module 2 (OpenAI - No Research)
Add to existing filter:
- `15.event.subtype` does NOT exist  ‚Üê ADD
- `15.event.bot_id` does NOT exist   ‚Üê ADD

### Step 5: Update Module 6 (Perplexity - With Research)
Add to existing filter:
- `15.event.subtype` does NOT exist  ‚Üê ADD
- `15.event.bot_id` does NOT exist   ‚Üê ADD

## üîç How to Check Event Data

To see what your bot messages actually contain:

1. Go to Make.com scenario execution history
2. Click on a run where the bot triggered itself
3. Look at Module 15 output
4. Find the `event` object
5. Check for these fields:
   ```json
   {
     "event": {
       "type": "message",
       "subtype": "bot_message",    ‚Üê This will exist for bot messages
       "bot_id": "B09XXXXXXXXX",     ‚Üê This will exist for bot messages
       "user": "U09NHH78SQK",        ‚Üê The bot's user ID
       "text": "...",
       "ts": "1234567890.123456"
     }
   }
   ```

## üß™ Testing

After making changes:

1. **Clear the datastore** (remove all existing event IDs)
2. **Turn off the scenario**
3. **Turn it back on**
4. **Send ONE test message** as yourself (not the bot)
5. **Expected result**: Bot responds ONCE, then stops

### What to Check:
- ‚úÖ Bot responds to YOUR message: YES (should respond)
- ‚úÖ Bot responds to ITS OWN message: NO (should be blocked)
- ‚úÖ Only 1-2 Make.com executions: YES (not 10+)
- ‚úÖ Datastore has 1 entry: YES (your message event ID)

## üéØ Why This Works

### Human Message:
```json
{
  "event": {
    "type": "message",
    "user": "U09JV1FUPMJ",    ‚Üê Your user ID
    "text": "Create a post",
    "ts": "1234567890.123456"
    // NO subtype
    // NO bot_id
  }
}
```
**Result**: Passes all filters ‚úÖ ‚Üí Bot processes it

### Bot Message:
```json
{
  "event": {
    "type": "message",
    "subtype": "bot_message",    ‚Üê HAS subtype
    "bot_id": "B09PJ8DT2HE",     ‚Üê HAS bot_id
    "user": "U09NHH78SQK",
    "text": "Here's your post...",
    "ts": "1234567890.123457"
  }
}
```
**Result**: Blocked by `subtype` filter ‚ùå ‚Üí Bot ignores it

## üö® Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå WRONG - Checking authorizations:
```
15.authorizations.is_bot = false
```
This checks the app type, not the message sender!

### ‚ùå WRONG - Only checking user ID:
```
15.event.user not equal to "U09NHH78SQK"
```
Bots can post with different user IDs. You need to check the event type!

### ‚úÖ CORRECT - Checking event subtype and bot_id:
```
15.event.subtype does NOT exist
AND
15.event.bot_id does NOT exist
```
This reliably detects ALL bot messages!

## üìä Filter Priority

Most reliable to least reliable:

1. **`event.subtype` does NOT exist** - 99% reliable
2. **`event.bot_id` does NOT exist** - 95% reliable
3. **`event.user` not equal to bot ID** - 80% reliable (user IDs can change)
4. **`authorizations.is_bot`** - ‚ùå NOT RELIABLE (checks app, not message)

## üîß Debug: See What's Actually Being Sent

Add a temporary email notification after Module 15:

**Module: Tools ‚Üí Send Email**
- To: your-email@example.com
- Subject: "Debug: Event Data"
- Body:
  ```
  Event Type: {{15.event.type}}
  Subtype: {{15.event.subtype}}
  Bot ID: {{15.event.bot_id}}
  User: {{15.event.user}}
  Text: {{15.event.text}}

  Authorizations Bot: {{15.authorizations[].is_bot}}
  Authorizations User: {{15.authorizations[].user_id}}
  ```

Trigger the loop once, check your email, and you'll see exactly what fields exist!

## üìù Complete Filter Template

Copy this for EVERY module that processes content:

```
Condition Groups (ALL of the following):
[
  [
    15.event.type equals "event_callback",
    15.event.event.type equals "message",
    15.event.subtype does NOT exist,
    15.event.bot_id does NOT exist,
    15.event.user not equal to "U09JV1FUPMJ",
    15.event.user is not empty
  ]
]
```

**Remove ANY filters checking `15.authorizations.is_bot`!**

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist

After implementing:

- [ ] Removed all `authorizations.is_bot` filters
- [ ] Added `event.subtype does NOT exist` to all filters
- [ ] Added `event.bot_id does NOT exist` to all filters
- [ ] Cleared the datastore
- [ ] Tested with one message
- [ ] Bot responded exactly once
- [ ] No loop detected after 30 seconds
- [ ] Make.com shows only 1-2 executions

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

If the bot still loops after this fix:

1. **Export your scenario** to JSON
2. **Check Make.com execution history**
3. **Look at Module 15 output** when the loop occurs
4. **Find the `event` object** in the data
5. **Check if `subtype` or `bot_id` exists**
6. **Verify filters are set to "does NOT exist"** (not "equals false")

The issue is 99% likely that:
- You're still filtering on `authorizations` instead of `event`
- OR the filter logic is "OR" instead of "AND"
- OR you typed "does not equal" instead of "does NOT exist"

## üéì Understanding the Difference

### authorizations array
- Shows who **installed** the app
- Shows app permissions
- `is_bot: true` means the app is a bot app
- ‚ùå **Does NOT tell you who sent the message**

### event object
- Shows the **actual message data**
- Shows who sent the message
- Has `subtype` and `bot_id` for bot messages
- ‚úÖ **This is what you need to filter on**

That's why your current filters don't work - you're checking the wrong object!

## üöÄ After This Fix

Once you've updated all filters:

1. Your bot will only respond to **human messages**
2. Bot messages will be **completely ignored**
3. No more loops!
4. Make.com execution count will match message count

Good luck! This should fix the issue completely.
